Best way to get working in eclipse:

Create new Django project in Eclipse PyDev called simpris.

To check it is OK right click on project in Eclipse then 'Run As' then 'PyDev Django'

The project should then run.

Then copy the other files from the project into the simpris folder in Eclipse workspace. This should overwrite manage.py, urls.py, wsgi.py etc.
